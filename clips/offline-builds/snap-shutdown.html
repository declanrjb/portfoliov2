                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>More than 37 thousand residents of Lorain County will lose SNAP food assistance benefits in November 
                        due to the ongoing government shutdown, according to <a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/snap-population-metrics?visualize=true">open data</a> published by the state of Ohio.</p>
                    <p>Since Oct. 1, the federal government has largely ceased operations due to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-government-shutdown/">ongoing partisan standoff</a>
                        over issues including federal spending, foreign aid, and healthcare. Without an appropriations bill 
                        to fund the government, and no path to passing one in sight, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
                        announced Monday that it will cease all SNAP food benefits on Nov. 1.</p>
                    <p>“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” reads a notice pinned at the top of the department’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">website</a>. 
                        “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”</p>
                    <p>The loss of benefits will affect thousands of Lorain County residents, more than 11 percent of whom rely on 
                        SNAP to some degree. In September 2025, more than 37 thousand county residents received a combined six 
                        million dollars in food assistance through the SNAP program.</p>
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/25876185"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25876185/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="map visualization" /></noscript></div>
                    <p>The impending loss of benefits has sparked debate in the Ohio statehouse, with Democrats in the State 
                        Senate introducing a measure to fund SNAP to an unrelated spending bill that subsequently failed to 
                        pass, according to <a href="https://signalohio.bluelena.io/index.php?action=social&chash=043c3d7e489c69b48737cc0c92d0f3a2.609&s=2b24872d09b3c678c1554a5e891ebee6">reporting from Signal Ohio</a>. State Republicans have called on Democrats in Congress 
                        to bring an end to the shutdown and reopen the government, while State Democrats have encouraged 
                        Ohio’s governor Mike DeWine to declare a state of emergency and allocate $100 million to food aid.</p>
                    <p>Begun in 1939, the modern SNAP program provides low-income households with monthly funds that can 
                        be used at grocery stores or other food vendors. In 2024, 41 million people in the United States 
                        were enrolled in SNAP, receiving a cumulative 93 billion dollars in food assistance that year.</p>
                    <p>Residents packed the waiting room of Oberlin Community Services on Wednesday afternoon, as a line for the 
                        organization’s food pantry stretched out the door.</p>
                    <p>Kelly, a patron who asked to be identified by her first name only, said that she relies on the pantry 
                        as a caretaker of four disabled family members. Lines for food, she said, have visibly lengthened 
                        since the shutdown began in early October.</p>
                    <p>“People are running scared right now,” Kelly said, “especially those with children.”</p>
                    <p>Jason Hawk, Communications Director for Oberlin Community Services, said that the center has seen a 
                        marked rise in the number of families seeking food assistance since the shutdown began. “There 
                        are a lot of clients who are coming to the food pantry, and they’re voicing real concerns about 
                        being anxious and nervous about what the next couple of months are going to hold,” Hawk said.</p>
                    <p>Every year, the pantry sees a surge in demand in the early fall, Hawk said. Yet demand this year has 
                        outpaced that trend. Since September, roughly 400 families have received food assistance from the 
                        pantry each week, Hawk said, up from 300 to 350 in previous years.</p>
                    <p>The impacts of the shutdown may soon be felt by the pantry itself, which receives almost 90 percent 
                        of its food stock from <a href="https://secondharvestfoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank of North Central Ohio</a>. Due to the shutdown, food 
                        banks across the country, including Second Harvest, have lost the ability to place new orders for 
                        food stocks traditionally provided to charities in bulk by the USDA.</p>
                    <p>The cutoff will have ripple effects in the months to come, according to Julie Chase-Morefield, 
                        President and CEO of Second Harvest’s North Central Ohio location. “Generally speaking orders 
                        are placed 3-4 months before they are received,” Chase-Morefield said. “The impact will be 
                        felt in the coming months because shipments will be delayed.”</p>
                    <p>Beginning this week, Oberlin College Facilities Operations will be collecting donations for the 
                        Oberlin Community Services food pantry. Donations can be delivered to the Facilities Operations 
                        office in the Service Building between 8am and 4:30pm.</p>
